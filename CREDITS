VMware Photon Linux materialized in an instant and is moving at light speed. Any Linux distribution (including Photon) benefits from the thousands of contributions from the free software and open software community. A full listing of the third party components in the Photon distribution can be found at the third party licenses file.
 
The Photon Project gratefully acknowledge these contributions. This file calls out specific contributions from the community that deserve special mention.
 
1) GNU and the Free Software Foundation

Free software as we know it today would probably not exist but for the pioneering work of the FSF.  Keeping with the tradition of GNU/Linux, VMware’s Photon distribution and build system will be released under the GPL 2.0 License.  
 
2) Linux from Scratch -  http://www.linuxfromscratch.org
 
Photon is built from scratch – it’s not a fork of any existing Linux distribution. In building Photon, the team has benefited greatly from the Linux From Scratch (LFS) approach. We acknowledge the simplicity, elegance and clarity of Linux From Scratch.
 
3) LFS-RPM - Baho Utot https://github.com/baho-utot/LFS-RPM

Photon automates the LFS model of constructing a Linux system through the RPM build process. 

When we began Photon, we found Baho Utot's LFS-RPM project and we considered using it as the 

basis of bootstrapping our build system. We requested Baho to clarify the license terms of 

LFS-RPM and Baho very graciously released all of LFS-RPM into the public domain. Thank you!  

As a result, Photon was bootstrapped with Baho's LFS-RPM project.

4) RPM Spec files

Photon maintains its own spec files. The initial release of Photon comprises over 200 Linux packages. Of these, around 30 spec files come from the Fedora project. We gratefully acknowledge this. As we evolve our spec files moving forward, we will document their lineage.
